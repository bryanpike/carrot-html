# Carrot
## Description
Keeping up with Bobby Rabbits' events has never been easier!

Have you ever tried to organize a poker night or online gaming event with friends across muttiple time zones? It's a HUGE pain to track down everyone's time zones, do the math, and spread the word!!! Our new calendar is the perfect tool for connecting community memebers from around the world, no matter where they're located. With **Carrot** you can easily switch the time zone to check what time an event will take place for your friends in order to better coordinate online meetups. Additionally, when a user adds an event to the Carrot Calendar, the data is stored on the cloud! This allows multiple communities to install the app on their sites too so that events can be more easily coordinated with partnering projects! Setting up a Rumble Battle Royale, a Twitter Space, or Poker Night with friends across the globe has never been easier!
